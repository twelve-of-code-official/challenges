        <h2>April 2024, Challenge 1</h2>
        <p>
            Your boss wants to know what companies are owned by other companies. To help you out
            with this, you found an API that takes a company as an input and returnes the company
            that owns it. While testing the API, you realized that it didn't use the right results
            because it resulted in a loop. You decided to go on their GitHub page to report this,
            but they ask for how many companies are in the loop.
        </p>
        <h3>Your Goal</h3>
        <p>Figure out the total number of companies that are in the loop.</p>
        <p>
            For example, if we start with <code class="inline language-txt">Lay's</code>, and it
            outputs <code class="inline language-txt">Doritos</code>, then that means
            <code class="inline language-txt">Doritos</code> owns
            <code class="inline language-txt">Lay's</code>. (Obviously, this is fictional and
            completely inaccurate.)
        </p>
        <p>Let's say we have a list that looks like the following.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-txt">Lay's
Doritos
Wholly Guacamole
Fritos
Whole Foods
Wholly Guacamole</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can see that a loop will start because
            <code class="inline language-txt">Wholly Guacamole</code> appears twice. Your goal is to
            detect this loop and how many companies are in the loop. In this example, there are 3
            companies in the loop: <code class="inline language-txt">Wholly Guacamole</code>,
            <code class="inline language-txt">Fritos</code>, and
            <code class="inline language-txt">Whole Foods</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API is at
            <span class="blue"
                >https://mesure.x10.mx/twelve-of-code/api/challenges/2024/apr/1/api.php</span
            >. However, this is not enough information. You need to input your seed and the input,
            both as parameters. Your seed is <span id="seed" class="yellow"></span> and your
            starting input is <span id="start" class="yellow"></span>.
        </p>
        <p>If you did it correctly, the server will respond with something like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">{
    "input": {
        "seed": YOUR_SEED,
        "input": YOUR_INPUT
    },
    "output": OUTPUT_COMPANY
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The output is the name of the company that owns the company that you inputted. Keep in
            mind that the server needs your seed to give you the correct response, and if you input
            the seed incorrectly, you will not be able to complete the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the example from before, if we started with
            <code class="inline language-txt">Lay's</code>, and our seed is
            <code class="inline language-txt">TEST_SEED</code>, the server would output the
            following:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">{
    "input": {
        "seed": "TEST_SEED",
        "input": "Lay's"
    },
    "output": "Doritos"
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Your program will have to continue this until it finds a loop. Then, it will have to
            tell you how many companies are in the loop. With the example from before, the correct
            answer would be <code class="inline language-txt">3</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to test your program with the example, you can input your seed as
            <span class="green bold">TEST_SEED</span> and the API will make sure you are getting the
            challenge from the example, so you can easily test your program and not have to submit
            the answer until you have a working program.
        </p>
